**Disclaimer:** This is my journey learning kotlin + FP. Many of the concepts that I've applied here is not completely right or it could 
be written in a better way.

### About this repository

This project is composed by some of my experiments and thoughts trying to apply some functional programming concepts 
with kotlin.

I am exploring how I can write more than a simple CRUD with Kotlin + Ktor, adding basic elements that we can find in a real project like
validations, integration tests, authentication and authorization, aws integration, arrow-kt datatypes, working with exposed.

This is not a final state for this project and not even a way that I would recommend to organize a real project like that.
After reach this stage I've noticed that many things could be implemented following a better approach.
